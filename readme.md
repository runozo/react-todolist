# ReactJS Todo app

Actually, it's an obsolete toolchain, but a useful getting started app.

## Getting started

- clone this repo
- locally cd into it
- ```npm install```
- ```npm start```

**N.B.** you need a Firebase db already configured. Put the config in "config/development.env" and "config/test.env" files.

You need these variables configured:
```
API_KEY=
AUTH_DOMAIN=
DATABASE_URL=
STORAGE_BUCKET=
```

## Testing

```
npm test
```
